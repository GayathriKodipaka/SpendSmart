# SpendSmart
 Managing personal finances is crucial for individuals and businesses alike. However, traditional
 methods often lack the real-time insights and live market updates required for effective financial
 decision-making. This project addresses the challenge of creating an interactive financial
 dashboard that not only allows users to track their income, expenses, and balance but also
 provides live updates on key financial indices such as Gold, Silver, Nifty 50, and Sensex.
 
 The goal is to empower users with a visually appealing and functional web application that
 enables:
 
 ● Easy addition of financial transactions.
 
 ● Real-time balance updates.
 
 ● Visualization of financial trends using graphs.
 
 ● Access to live market prices for informed decision-making.
 

Implementation

 The project is implemented as follows:
 
 Tools and Technologies
 
 ● Frontend: HTML, CSS for layout and design.

 ● Logic: JavaScript for functionality.
 
 ● Visualization: Chart.js for rendering graphs.
